The 3DVis package provides a bundle for coregistering brain imaging data to create 3D reconstructions with electrode placement and labeled brain regions. For setup and use instructions, see Coregister.pdf in the doc folder.

This package contains many components of open source, freely available software that I did not develop, but they are included in the package for ease of use and installation. For more information about individual components, please see the documentation or viist the original developers' websites.
